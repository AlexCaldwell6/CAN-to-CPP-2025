# CAN-TO-C++-2025

This is a UI interface for [Team Sunergy](https://github.com/Team-Sunergy) of Appalachian State. It allows a Raspberry Pi to read and display CAN messages using 
Qt via C++. It may only be edited using Qt Creator, or other IDEs with access to Qt Designer.

## Features and Objectives (Current)

- Rudimentary SOC and speedometers with simulation.

## Features and Objectives (Planned)

- Interface the Pi with the CAN bus
- Recieve CAN messages
- Display data to driver and passengers
- Support for mobile
- User-friendly interface
- Readable, maintainable code
- Instructions for setting up the system.

## Display Widgets

- **At a glance**
- Speed, state of charge

- **Motor controllers**
- Battery voltage/current, motor rotating speed,
- pulse width modulation, field effect transistor temp

- **Battery Management**
- High/low voltage cells, temperature

- **MPPTS**
- Input/Output, voltage/current, temperature

- **Console?**
