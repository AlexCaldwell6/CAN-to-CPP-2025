# CAN-TO-C++-2025

This is a UI interface for Team Sunergy of Appalachian State.

It allows a Raspberry Pi to read and display CAN messages using 
Qt via C++. It may only be edited using Qt Creator, or other IDEs
with access to Qt Designer.

This is a continuation of the ROSE-CAN-to-Pi-2024 project by:
- Nathan Care
- John Waugh
- Blaez Jibben
- Sean Choi

A lot of the work in this initial commit is essentially a Python-Qt
translation of theirs, so they deserve credit.
